# EDA-Food-Delivery
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (Zomato.ipynb) in which I perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Zomato restaurant dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal of this project was to explore the dataset, clean it, and gain insights.
Key Insights and Learnings:
Data Cleaning: How to handle missing values.
Data Transformation: Converting categorical data into numerical representations to enable easier analysis.
Visualization: Using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize various aspects of the dataset, such as the distribution of restaurant ratings, the most popular cuisines, and the relationship between restaurant cost and rating.
Handling Categorical Data: Understanding how to handle categorical variables like cuisines and locations in the dataset.
Requirements
To run this project and reproduce the analysis in the Jupyter notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
